# Idle Game


## What is this?

This is a hobby project with a hope to eventually make a idle clicker game.


## Current State

Currently we are adding 5 "workers" (added to the top of the screen, random position).

We can tap anywhere in the canvas to add "targets".

Workers will pick up jobs from a queue to consume the targets.


## How to run locally

```shell
# install dependencies
npm install

# run the server
npm run dev
```
