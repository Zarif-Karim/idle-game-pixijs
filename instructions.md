Hi, looks like you're new here 🤩
Please give this a quick read to know whats going on!

Think of it as a moderate take away restaurant. You've got the Kitchen with different
stations to make different meals. You've got the sitting area where customers sit
and make their orders through the waiters. The waiters processes the order, the kitchen
staff makes it and the waiter finally delivers it.

The Green blobs are the kitchen workers,
the Blue ones are the waiters,
and White ones are customers.
The Orange squares are the customer waiting areas.
The different colored squares are your menu items prep stations.
The grey bar is the transfer station from back to front staff.

Starting out you have a bit of coins to unlock the first menu item.
Marked unlockable/upgradable by the red marker.
As you make sales, you gather money to be able to upgrade stations,
and unlock more menu items. Upgrading stations increases the product prices.

On the top right corner, the brown square with the yellow arrow has more upgrade.
Click on it and check it out after this 🎇
That is also marked with a red dot when upgrades are available.

Your aim is to make as much money as possible and live the luxury life 💸

Lets get cracking 🏃🚀
