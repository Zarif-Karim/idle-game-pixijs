Hi, looks like you're new here ğŸ¤©

Please give this a quick read to know whats going on!
(You can also open this anytime by clicking the ${ICONS.GEAR}> ${ICONS.INFO})

Think of it as a take away restaurant. Yippie!!

    - You've got the Kitchen with different stations
        to make different meals
    - You've got the sitting area where customers sit
        and make their orders through the waiters
    - The waiters processes the order
    - The kitchen staff makes it
    - The waiter finally delivers it

Simply right? :)

Heres a quick summary of who is who:

    - ğŸŸ¢'s are the kitchen workers,
    - ğŸ”µ's are the waiters,
    - âšª's are customers.

    - ğŸŸ§'s are the customer waiting areas.
    - The colored squares are your menu item prep stations.
    - The grey bar is the transfer station from back to front staff.

Starting out you have a bit of coins to unlock the first menu item.
Marked unlockable/upgradable by the ğŸ”´marker.

As you make sales, you gather money to upgrade stations,
and unlock more menu items.
Upgrading stations increases the product prices.

On the top right corner, 
the brown square with the yellow arrow has more upgrades.
Click on it and check it out after.
It also shows the ğŸ”´marker when upgrades are available.

Your aim is to make as much money as possible 
and live the luxury life ğŸ’¸

Lets get cracking ğŸš€
